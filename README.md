# Dribbble To App Series

Here at [JumpByte](http://www.jumpbyte.com) we have been developing mobile applications for a long time. With each application we try to do something different. We have been honing our skills to develop good quality nice looking apps and we are truly inspired by Dribbble Community.

So we decided to run a small app series where we take good designs from Dribbble and develop it into working apps. Most of the design that we have selected so far is one or two screen apps. The series will include some applications iPhone and some for Android.

Disclaimer: The series is just for fun, without any intensions of copying anyone's hard work. We pay our credits to designer with each app we develop.
